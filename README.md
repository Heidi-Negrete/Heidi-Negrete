- 👋 Hi, I’m Heidi, a software engineer and a lover of learning.
- :wrench: Right now I'm tinkering with Python and studying for my AWS Cloud Foundations cert in pursuit of my B.S Software Engineering at WGU. 

- ✨ I want to build a career in software development that involves teamwork and life-long learning. 
- 💞️ I infuse purpose into my day-to-day work, to operate with a high level of enthusiasm <em>every</em> day.
