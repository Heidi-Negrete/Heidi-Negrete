- 👋 Hi, I’m Heidi, an aspiring software developer and chronic scholar.
- 🌱 I believe that life can be be unbelievably beautiful and fulfilling, if you just be yourself.
- :wrench: What am I working on right now? I'm tinkering with JavaScript and studying for my second A+ certification exam. 

- ✨ I want to build a career that serves people and involves teamwork and life-long learning. 
- 💞️ I infuse purpose into my day-to-day work, to operate with a high level of enthusiasm <em>every</em> day.
- :family: My interests and experience are varied: I've worked as a medical assistant, a teacher, in customer service, and as a manager. This has made me comfortable working with people in all age-groups and from all walks of life.
