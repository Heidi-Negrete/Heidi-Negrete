- 👋 Hi, I’m Heidi, an aspiring software developer and a lover of learning.
- 🌱 I believe that life can be be unbelievably beautiful and fulfilling, if you just be yourself.
- :wrench: What am I working on right now? I'm tinkering with JavaScript and REST apis, and studying database fundamentals. 

- ✨ I want to build a career that serves people and involves teamwork and life-long learning. 
- 💞️ I infuse purpose into my day-to-day work, to operate with a high level of enthusiasm <em>every</em> day.
