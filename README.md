- 👋 Hi, I’m Heidi, a junior software engineer and a lover of learning.
- 🎊 Graduated this March with my B.S Software Engineering from WGU!
- 📖 Preparing for my first engineering role by reviewing DSA and building a few projects.
- 🔧 I'm currently tinkering with TypeScript React and Godot(C#). 
- ✨ I want to build a career that involves teamwork and life-long learning.
- 💞️ I infuse purpose into my day-to-day work, to operate with a high level of enthusiasm <em>every</em> day.
